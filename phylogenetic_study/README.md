# Phylogenetic study

This folder contains a few reports that include:

* Data preparation for identifying ejectives and uvulars in [PHOIBLE](https://phoible.org/) and creating the associated traits file for the phylogenetic analysis: [phylogenetic_study.md](phylogenetic_study.md)

* A script to prune the phylogenies of Indo-European and Sino-Tibetan language families trees with the set of traits (has/does not have ejectives or uvulars): [phylogenetic_study_prune.md](phylogenetic_study_prune.md)

* Plots of the IE and ST phylogenies and stochastic character maps of the ejectives and uvular traits data from PHOIBLE: [phylogenetic_study_plots.md](phylogenetic_study_plots.md)

* Plots of the IE and ST phylogenies and stochastic character maps of the ejectives and uvular traits data from PHOIBLE and extended via data mining of Glottolog from Harald Hamm√§rstrom: [phylogenetic_study_plots-Harald.md](phylogenetic_study_plots-Harald.md)
