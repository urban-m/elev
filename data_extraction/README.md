# Phylogenetic study

This folder contains scripts to extract ejectives and uvular counts from the [PHOIBLE database](https://github.com/phoible/dev) and to append them with metadata from the [Glottolog](https://glottolog.org/).

* To extract the counts, see: [get_uvulars_ejectives.md](get_uvulars_ejectives.md)

* To append counts without uvular rhotics, see: [remove_uvular_rhotics.md](remove_uvular_rhotics.md)
